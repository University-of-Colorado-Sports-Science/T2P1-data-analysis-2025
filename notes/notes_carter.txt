Title: Carter's Notes
Date: 6/5/25-6/9/25

Incidence Report Football:

Hamstring tear/strain: TM1 (OSICS14.code), TMHX (OMICS10.code)
Semimembranosus/tendinitis strain (grade 1-2): TMS (OSICS14.code), TMHS (OMICS10.code)

Both have S76.3 ICD10.code

Probably use complete evaluation, could consider other injuries the players with hamstring injuries are dealing with, especially in hip/groin area, can consider if result of sport injury and recurrence of injury
Lots of duplicate entries

Percentage of event completed and event type could show fatigue

Could look at field type

Days in status or total time injured or total.time.injured1

Injury.Date_c, FinalDiagnosisIncidentDate, 

VALD:

Trend, Maximum.Force, Nordic.Left.MAX, Nordic.Right.MAX, Percent.Difference.Norm, Nordic.Maximum.Bilateral.Force, Nordic.MEAN.Imbalance

Strength Testing dataset contains ratios between quadriceps and hamstrings

Performance Risk Assessment dataset has hamstring eccentric vs concentric with only 115 observations

Could try to experiment with running data although not included in their model

HSI includes: TM1 (hamstring strain), TMB (biceps femoris strain grade 1-2), TMH (hamstring cramping), TMS (semimembranosis/tendinosis sprain grade 1-2), TMY (trigger points), TR1 (hamstring tendon injury)
Quads: THQ (haematoma), TMCQ (quad cramping), TMR (rectus femoris strain), TMT (trigger points)
Adductors: TMAL (adductor longus strain), TMM (adductor magnus strain)
Glutes: TMG (gluteus medius/minimus strain)
Other: THT (thigh haematoma), THX (other bruising), TIX (thigh abrasion), TMC (thigh cramping), TML (back muscle tightness), TMZ (thigh muscle strain/spasms/trigger points)
